Q: How did diff help me see the bug? 
A: It showed me all of the lines that had differences so I didn't have to look
at every line individually. It saved time and increased accuracy. 

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history 
of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: It could show me how I have taken the long way around to solve a 
problem. 

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A: It makes me remember to save, causes me to think logically about when to save the work I've done, and allows me to do the commit at the most
logical and useful time. 

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A: Each is addressing different user needs. 

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 
A: You can see all the commands that have been executed and you can see line-by-line changes in code. 

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? 
A: It gives full confidence that the project can be rescued from a big error. 

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A: I want to use it to help me get a portfolio set up.
